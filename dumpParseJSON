Revised Commands for Accurate Parsing

    Q1: Total Entries in the Log File
        Count the total number of lines, as each line is likely one log entry:

    wc -l activity.log

Q2: Number of Distinct Calendar Dates

    Assuming the date is embedded within a timestamp field like "timestamp":"2024-04-17T04:00:00.000Z", we can extract the date part from the timestamp:

    grep -o '"timestamp":"[0-9]\{4\}-[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9]\{2\}' activity.log | sort | uniq | wc -l

Q3: Date with the Most Events

    Extract dates from the timestamp field and count occurrences to find the date with the most events:

    grep -o '"timestamp":"[0-9]\{4\}-[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9]\{2\}' activity.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 1

Q4: User with the Most Entries

    Extract the user field and count occurrences to find the user with the most entries:

    grep -o '"user":"[^"]*"' activity.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 1

Q5: User with the Most Power Failures

    Filter for "System Shutdown" (code 100) and "System Reboot" (code 110), then extract the user field to find the user with the most power failures:

    grep -E '"event":(100|110)' activity.log | grep -o '"user":"[^"]*"' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 1

Q6: Most Frequent Source IP for Downloads

    Assuming "File Transfer" (event code 20) represents downloads, filter for this event and extract the source IP field:

        grep '"event":20' activity.log | grep -o '"source":"[^"]*"' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 1

These commands should be more accurate by specifically extracting fields based on the JSON-like structure in the log file. Let me know if this approach provides the correct results or if you encounter further issues!

Improved Command for Total Entries

    Q1: Counting Total Entries
    If each entry is enclosed within {...}, we can count the occurrences of { at the start of each entry as a unique identifier.

grep -c '^{' activity.log

Alternatively, if the log entries are formatted in JSON objects where each entry begins with a specific key (like "user" or "timestamp"), you can count lines that contain that key:

grep -c '"user"' activity.log

Verify with Other Filters
In cases where entries don't have consistent markers, you may need to check the log format further. If every entry has a unique event identifier like "event":, you can count lines that contain this field:

    grep -c '"event"' activity.log

t looks like the log format for downloads (event 20) uses "srcIp" rather than "source". Additionally, event 200 may relate to network connections rather than downloads, so we'll exclude it from our search.

To find the most frequent IP address for downloads, hereâ€™s an updated command:
Revised Command for Question 6

grep '"event":20' activity.log | grep -o '"srcIp":"[^"]*"' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 1

This command will:

    Filter entries specifically for event 20.
    Extract IP addresses from the "srcIp" field.
    Count occurrences and sort to find the most frequent IP.
