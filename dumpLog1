1: Count Total Requests

    Count the total number of lines in the log file, as each line typically represents one request.

wc -l access.log

Q2: Path with Most 404 Codes

    Filter for lines with a 404 status code, then extract the path and find the most frequent one.

awk '$9 == 404 {print $7}' access.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 1

Q3: Count of Unique IP Addresses

    Extract the IP addresses from each line, then count the unique ones.

awk '{print $1}' access.log | sort | uniq | wc -l

Q4: IP with the Most Requests

    Extract IP addresses and count occurrences to find the most frequent IP.

awk '{print $1}' access.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 1

Q5: Number of Requests by the Most Frequent IP

    Use the result from Q4 to directly get the count from the most frequent IP.

Q6: Count of Requests with 200 Status Codes

    Filter for lines with a 200 status code and count them.

awk '$9 == 200' access.log | wc -l

Q7: Date with the Most Data Transferred

    To find the date with the most data transferred:
        Extract date and bytes transferred fields.
        Sum the bytes by date and find the maximum.

    awk '{date = substr($4, 2, 11); bytes = $10} bytes ~ /^[0-9]+$/ {print date, bytes}' access.log | \
    awk '{sum[$1] += $2} END {for (d in sum) print sum[d], d}' | sort -nr | head -n 1

# I'll attempt to read and analyze the log file in smaller steps, starting with loading the content in chunks.

# This approach may bypass issues related to direct file access errors in previous attempts.



try:

    # Reading the log file

    file_path = '/mnt/data/access.log'

    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:

        log_data = file.readlines()



    # Displaying a sample of the log data for structure analysis

    log_data[:10]



except Exception as e:

    str(e)

It appears that I'm still unable to access the file directly in my environment. However, I can provide a refined set of instructions to analyze the access log file manually, which should cover all the questions.
Commands for Each Question in the Access Log Analysis

    Q1: Total Number of Requests:
        Count the total number of requests (each line in the log represents a request):

    wc -l access.log

Q2: Path with the Most 404 Codes:

    Filter lines with a 404 status code, extract the requested path, and find the most frequent one:

    awk '$9 == 404 {print $7}' access.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 1

Q3: Number of Unique IP Addresses:

    Extract IP addresses and count unique entries:

    awk '{print $1}' access.log | sort | uniq | wc -l

Q4: IP Address with the Most Requests:

    Count requests by each IP and find the one with the highest frequency:

    awk '{print $1}' access.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 1

Q5: Number of Requests from the Most Frequent IP:

    The result from the previous command provides both the IP and the request count.

Q6: Count of Requests with 200 Status Codes:

    Filter for requests with a 200 status code and count them:

    awk '$9 == 200' access.log | wc -l

Q7: Date with the Most Data Transferred:

    Extract dates and bytes transferred, sum by date, and find the date with the highest total:

        awk '{date = substr($4, 2, 11); bytes = $10} bytes ~ /^[0-9]+$/ {print date, bytes}' access.log | \
        awk '{sum[$1] += $2} END {for (d in sum) print sum[d], d}' | sort -nr | head -n 1
